# Shared Learning
This github will contain folders for learning to code in general, and for crypto specifically.

### Step 1: Install Linux
Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used by developers and unknowingly by the general population. It is easier to use for coding vs Windows or OSX. It is possible to have both Windows and Linux on the same computer in case you want to play computer games or something.

Instructions provided in tutorials are often written for Linux users.

### Step 2: Install Git
Git allows you to easily download packages and software from places like github onto your computer, then update any porjects you are working on. Commands will look like this:

`git clone https://github.com/willwooten/blake_will_shared_learning_depo`

The above code will copy this folder onto your computer, and connect it to github so you can save your work in a github repository.

### Step 3: Install VS Code
This is software used for editing code. It is well intergrated with github, and works with all the languages you'll want to use.

## Basics
### Javascript
Important language for web development. 
### CSS
CSS is "Custom Style Sheets" and is how websites are styled (choosing fonts/colors/sizes/etc/etc)
### Python
Great language to learn for day-to-day data projects.
### SQL
The most basic database language, widely used in business and web development. Clunky and hard to read. Websites and businesses use mySQL, noSQL, PostgreSQL for their databases, which are all slightly different.
### R
An easy to use, easy to read data language. Sort of the midway point between SQL and Python. 

## Crypto
### Solidity for Ethereum
Solidity is the programming language used for the Ethereum blockchain (and some others). It is very similar to Javascript. In order to build a dApp (dentralized app) on Ethereum, you will need to code in Solidity, Javascript, and web development stuff like CSS.

## Places to Learn
### Codeacademy.com
[Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a subscription-based place to learn many different languages in a structured way. 
### datacamp.com
[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is great for learning data-focused languages like Python (and others like R, SQL). It is subscription based so it will cost money, but it is structured in a way to make learning easier.
