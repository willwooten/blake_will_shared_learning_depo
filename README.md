# Shared Learning
This github will contain folders for learning to code in general, and for crypto specifically.

### Step 1: Install Linux
Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used by developers and the general population. It is easier to use for coding vs Windows or OSX. It is possible to have both Windows and Linux on the same computer in case you want to play computer games or something.

Instructions provided in tutorials are often written for Linux users.

### Step 2: Install Git
Git allows you to easily download packages and software from places like github onto your computer, then update any porjects you are working on. Commands will look like this:
`git clone https://github.com/willwooten/blake_will_shared_learning_depo`

### Step 3: Install VS Code
This is software used for editing code. It is well intergrated with github, and works with all the languages you'll want to use.
