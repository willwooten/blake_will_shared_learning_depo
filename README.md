# Shared Learning
This github will contain folders for learning to code in general, and for crypto specifically.

### Step 1: Install Linux
Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used by developers and unknowingly by the general population. It is easier to use for coding vs Windows or Apple OSX. It is possible to have both Windows and Linux on the same computer in case you want to play computer games or something.

Instructions provided in tutorials are often written for Linux users.

### Step 2: Install Git
Git allows you to easily download packages and software from places like github onto your computer, then update any projects you are working on. Commands will look like this:

`git clone https://github.com/willwooten/blake_will_shared_learning_depo`

The above code will copy this folder onto your computer, and connect it to github so you can save your work in a github repository.

### Step 3: Make Github Account
Github is where open-source development happens. It is where you'll find most software, tutorials, and where you can work on your own projects and save them.

### Step 4: Install VS Code
This is software used for editing code. It is well integrated with github, and works with all the languages you'll want to use.

## Programming Languages
I would suggest starting with Javascript and/or Python. They are the most basic and easy to use, while also being popular and widely used by business/websites. It is probably best to learn HTML/CSS as you go. 

**Google is your friend**. Any question you have, someone else already had the same question and posted it online at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) where they got an answer. For example, google "python turn list into string" and you will get your answer.
#### Javascript
Important language for web and app development. 
#### HTML
The language used to structure websites for the last 25 years. Easy. Learn as you go. 
#### CSS
CSS is "Custom Style Sheets" and is how websites are styled (choosing fonts/colors/sizes/etc/etc). Easy. Learn as you go.
#### Python
Great language to learn for day-to-day data projects. Currently the most popular and widely used programming language.
#### SQL
The most basic database language, widely used in business and web development. Clunky and hard to read. Websites and businesses use mySQL, noSQL, PostgreSQL for their databases, which are all slightly different.
#### R
An easy to use, easy to read data language. Sort of the midway point between SQL and Python. Not very popular so not necessary to learn. Skip it and go straight to Python.
#### Rust
A difficult base level programming language comparable to C++. Don't start here it will be way too confusing. This is a useful and fast language though after you've gotten a handle on Python/Javascript.
### Crypto
#### Solidity
Solidity is the programming language used for the Ethereum blockchain (and some others). It is very similar to Javascript. In order to build a dApp (decentralized app) on Ethereum, you will need to code in Solidity, Javascript, and web development stuff like CSS.
#### Bitcoin RPC
Bitcoin is designed to prioritize security instead of apps, which means many things that you can do on Ethereum you can't do with Bitcoin (yet...). You can however use the Bitcoin RPC to read the Bitcoin blockchain (and any other Bitcoin forks/clones like Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc, etc). This is used for on-chain analytics. Anyone running a Bitcoin node can see exactly where/when bitcoin moved from one place to another, the address where it was sent, and other metadata. To use the RPC you need to install and run a Bitcoin node.

## Places to Learn
#### Learn Javascript (free)
[Learn Javascript](https://learnjavascript.online/) is a free intro-level online tutorial for Javascript.
#### Learn Python (free)
[Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) has a free intro-level online tutorial for python with video.
#### Codeacademy.com
[Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a subscription-based place to learn many different languages in a structured way.
#### W3Schools
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a reference website for many programming languages. 
#### datacamp.com
[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is great for learning data-focused languages like Python (and others like R, SQL). It is subscription based so it will cost money, but it is structured in a way to make learning easier.
#### Udemy.com
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) is another subscription-based tutorial website for programming (among other things).
#### Programming Bitcoin
[Programming Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin) is a book/github to learn the very basics of blockchain technology. This is not only helpful for Bitcoin but also understanding Ethereum. Includes code/lessons on cryptography, creating bitcoin transactions from scratch, and more. This is how I learned.
#### Ethereum Developer Portal
The [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/) website has a section for learning Solidity and Ethereum development.
#### Solidity-by-Example
[Solidity-by-Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) has basic code examples for Ethereum contracts. This code is included in the [Solidity folder](https://github.com/willwooten/blake_will_shared_learning_depo/tree/main/Solidity/SolidityByExample) in this github repo.
#### scaffold-eth
[scaffold-eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth) is a github repository with the building blocks for creating Ethereum dApps. Provides great usable examples of dApps like decentralized exchanges, staking, and NFTs, but no tutorials.
#### Remix
[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online IDE (integrated development environment) for Ethereum. There you can code/edit/deploy contracts onto the Ethereum blockchain.
