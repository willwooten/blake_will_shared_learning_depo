Address
    .balance                # gwei
    .tranfer(Amount)        # gwei
    .send()                 # Bool
        ---- stops cascading exceptions, flips FALSE cancels transaction
        ---- watch out for *re-entrancy dangers*
    .call.gas.value()()     # gwei

    .send() and .transfer() send gas stipend, limits amount of gas for transaction

Global Objects
---- contain info about transaction
---- most important are:
        msg.sender          # initializing address 
        msg.value           # gwei 
        now                 # timestamp

Payable Function Address
---- cannot receive ETH unless *payable*
---- transaction fails if ETH sent to Function address not payable

Rule of thumb: You interact with outside addresses last, no matter what.

Mappings have no length. It's important to understand this. 
Arrays have a length, but, because how mappings are stored internally, they do not have a length.

Let's say you have a mapping mapping(uint => uint) myMapping, 
then all elements myMapping[0], myMapping[1], myMapping[123123], ... 
are already initialized with the default value
